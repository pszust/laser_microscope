# the prefix d_ before command means it will be directly executed by the program
# commands with no prefix means the program will look for file command.txt in scripts/ or scripts/base/
# the below line command executes script located in scripts/base/move_m30.txt
# the script in move_m30.txt file has 3 lines that 1. send move command to m30; 2. waits for the m30 to finish moving; 3. waits additional 0.5 seconds
move_m30(0, 0)  # move m30 stage to 0,0 position 

# the content of move_m30.txt file is:
d_move(1, 2)  # send move command to m30 (this time to (1,2) coords
d_wait_move()  # waits for the m30 to finish moving
d_wait(0.5)  # waits additional 0.5 seconds

d_set_m30_params(0.25, 4)  # this sets the velocity and acceleration parameters of M30 to 0.25 and 4 respectively
move_m30(0, 0)  # this moves the stage back to 0, 0 but very slowly

# this command will change sample name to 'example', for string arguments use ' not "
d_set_sample_name('example')  # equivalent of typing 'example' in Sample name field

d_save_img()  # equivalent of pressing 'Save' button below camera feed

# this loads pattern image (should be 1024x768 resolution), current working directory should be mikroskop2
d_load_img('patterns/test_pattern.png')  # equvalent of loading image though Control->Load pattern

# executing illuminate_here.txt script (turn the laser on for 10s with duty cycle of 25)
